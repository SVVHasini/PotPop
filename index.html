      <h2 class="What">What are house plants?</h2>
      <p>
        Indoor plants are nature’s way of decorating your room with life.  
        They don’t just sit in a pot — they breathe life into blank corners, purify the air, and bring calm to chaos.  
        Whether it’s a tiny succulent on your desk or a leafy giant in your living room, these green buddies turn your house into a home.  
        No garden? No problem. With indoor plants, you carry a piece of nature right into your everyday life — quietly growing, glowing, and making you feel good.

      <h2>In present generations their role</h2>
      <p>
        The houseplant craze made a huge comeback in the late 2010s — and this time, it went viral.  
        Thanks to Instagram and the rise of the “#Plantstagram” community, plants once seen in our grandparents’ homes became the new trendsetters.  
        Then came the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 — and suddenly, everyone wanted a jungle indoors.  
        With more time at home, people turned to plants for comfort, creativity, and connection.  
        Favorites like Monstera deliciosa, fiddle-leaf figs, and other lush aroids became the stars of the decade — not just for their beauty, but for their unique leaves, bold shapes, and the calm they brought into our homes.  
        It wasn’t just about flowers anymore — it was about living art.

      <h2>Production</h2>
      <p>
        Where do houseplants come from?  
        Some are carefully grown in greenhouses or nurseries, while others are taken directly from the wild — and that’s where the problem begins.  
        Wild plant collection has become a serious threat to rare species, especially those with limited habitats.  
        Beautiful but vulnerable plants like succulents, cacti, and carnivorous plants (including the famous Venus flytrap) are often at risk.  
        Thankfully, many growers now turn to more sustainable methods — growing plants from seeds, using cuttings, or even advanced techniques like tissue culture to meet demand without harming nature.

      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>
        Caring for houseplants is more than just watering — it's about creating a miniature ecosystem indoors.  
        Unlike outdoor plants, houseplants depend on balanced moisture, the right lighting, quality potting mix, and good ventilation to thrive.  
        Each species has its own needs, and those needs can shift depending on the pot size, room temperature, and even the position near a window.  
        Most indoor plants feel at home in temperatures between 15°C and 25°C (60°F–80°F) — mimicking the tropical or desert habitats they originally come from.  
        That’s why you’ll find succulents soaking in dry air, or tropical beauties enjoying the dim corners of your room.  
        Some plants grow under forest canopies, making them naturally suited for low-light conditions.  
        Healthy houseplants typically have upright stems and fresh, tidy leaves.  
        The leaves themselves can adapt — plants in bright areas may develop “sun leaves” with fewer chloroplasts, while those in shade grow “shade leaves” rich in chloroplasts to capture more light.  
        Lighting isn’t the only factor; humidity, air circulation, and potting soil also matter.  
        A good potting mix — usually a blend of peat or coir with vermiculite or perlite — helps with drainage and air flow.  
        But be careful: too much water can cause root rot, while too little dries them out.  
        Finally, don’t forget the nutrients! Your green friends need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with trace minerals like zinc, iron, and magnesium to stay strong, grow tall, and keep those leaves glowing.
